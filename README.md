# StressLevelClassification
This is a project for classifying student stress levels using both KNN and ANN algorithms.
The research question for the project was: Can you accurately predict a student's level of stress based on different physical, psychological, environmental, social, and academic factors?
The KNN model predicted stress levels with an accuracy of 0.8909, and the ANN model predicted stress levels with an accuracy of 0.996363639831543 and a loss of 0.008340387605130672.
